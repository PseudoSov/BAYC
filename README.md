Bored Ape Yacht Club Avatar for VTubeStudio

Hello I am Pseudo Sov (https://twitter.com/PseudoSov and ETH wallet 0x34da6b7cecA5A7321739B610285DAc5A4a19d185). I am a passionate believer in digital property & believe pseudononymous IDs will be an essential element of our lives moving forward. 

This means being able to truly use our wallets/NFTs as 'digital IDs'. This Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) Avatar is to help move that forward - it is free to use and anyone who wants to can fork it & add additional 'attributes' I havent included.

At the minute its made covering most of the Ape colours, laser eyes and Franklin's (https://twitter.com/ElectionDayMad1) gold ape in fast food outfit.

The model is optimised for VTubeStudio (https://twitter.com/VTubeStudio) as it is free via Steam. You can edit all the settings to make it more/less sensitive to eye movement, mouth movement etc and it will need to be personalised a bit for your face.

My aim is to add value and create a profile in the pseudonymous economy. You can reach out to me with proposals on Twitter DMs :)

Thanks,

PseudoSov
